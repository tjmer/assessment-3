    The internet works by networks connecting to oneanother.
You have your network at home that connects to your network
provider.  That connects you to the web sites on other networks.
    When you click a link it sends a request through your router
then to the dns server.  Which usually sends back the ip address
of the website you want to visit or linked clicked on.  When you have visited it before,
your browser might have it cached.
